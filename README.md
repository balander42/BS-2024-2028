Wifi Automatic Plant Waterer
This Github contians all relavent files used during development of my Wifi Automatic Plant Waterer project for ECE 1000

Project Summary
This project includes two raspberry pi pico wh's one of which is used to program any Plant Waterers connected to it via wifi and the other pico being programmed and uses the instructions given to it to water plants depending on the soil's moisture.

Project Capabilities
This version of the project while not advanced shows its capabilities to send instructions between two devices via wifi and be able to utilize those instructions properly. The following is the current capabilities of the Wifi Automatic Plant Waterer.

- Wifi Capability to be able to connect one or more devices together
- Soil Moisture sensor to be able to measure and know when to start and stop waterer a plant
- Supply power to all compenents in the system

Who am I?
-  Bryce Lander - Freshman Computer Engineering Major, Hardware and System Security Concentration - Designed and made the entire device
-  This project was developed because my dad loves plants and I thought it would be a good solution to help automatic some plants that may not need as much attention and just need watering.
